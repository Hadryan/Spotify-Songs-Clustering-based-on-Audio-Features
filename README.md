# Automation of Spotify playlist creation using high dimensional data with K-means clustering algorithm

### The goal of this project is to use a clustering algorithm to break down a large playlist into smaller ones.

You can fiend the explanation of all features used in this dataset in the following link: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features

## K_Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation From Scratch
K-Means is the most popular clustering algorithm. It uses an iterative technique to group unlabeled data into K clusters based on cluster centers (centroids). The data in each cluster are chosen such that their average distance to their respective centroid is minimized.
